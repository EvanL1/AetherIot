**Let AI agents run your physical space — safely, locally, deterministically.**

AetherEdge is an open-source, industry-neutral IoT edge kernel, runtime, and Rust SDK for Linux
gateways. It connects field devices, keeps authoritative live state in shared memory, runs
deterministic local rules and alarms, and stores embedded history — no Redis, no PostgreSQL, no
cloud service, no browser, no LLM required.

What makes it different: AI is a first-class *client* behind a typed, governed boundary. Agents
discover real capabilities over MCP and OpenAPI, propose changes, and commission behavior — while
device control stays deny-by-default, explicitly confirmed, and audited, and the edge keeps
executing deterministically even when no AI is connected.

AetherEdge is the edge product in the [AetherIoT platform](docs/overview/platform.md), alongside
[AetherCloud](https://github.com/EvanL1/AetherCloud) and
[AetherContracts](https://github.com/EvanL1/AetherContracts). The official energy-management
distribution is [AetherEMS](https://github.com/EvanL1/AetherEMS).

## Try it in five minutes

**Have a running edge system?** Expose it to your AI assistant as read-only MCP tools:

```bash
claude mcp add aether -- aether mcp
```

Then ask your assistant:

```text
Inspect my edge runtime and generate a read-only operations app for the
capabilities it exposes.
```

The MCP server talks to the authenticated API gateway (`aether-api:6005`), so set
`AETHER_ACCESS_TOKEN` for the session. Claude on your laptop, edge on a server? One line still
works: `claude mcp add aether -- ssh user@gateway aether mcp`, or point `AETHER_API_URL` at an
HTTPS ingress — see [Connect AI assistants](docs/guides/ai-assistants.md).

**No hardware?** The SDK compositions run anywhere, need no external service, and commission
nothing:

```bash
cargo run -p aether-example-minimal-gateway   # empty industry-neutral gateway
cargo run -p aether-example-energy-gateway    # disabled-by-default Energy Pack proof
```

You can also simulate devices on the wire — Modbus TCP/RTU, CAN, J1939 — and acquire from them
exactly like a physical site:

```bash
cargo run -p simulator -- --scenario tools/simulator/scenarios/pv_daily.yaml --port 5020
```

See [Getting Started](docs/guides/getting-started.md) for the full safe-empty runtime setup,
[Connect devices](docs/guides/connect-devices.md) for wiring channels, and the
[Agent Quickstart](https://docs.aetheriot.dev/agent-quickstart/) for a complete
assistant-driven setup.

## Install AetherEdge

For a Docker-based Linux edge host, download the matching `AetherEdge-<arch>-<version>.run` file and
its `.sha256` file from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/EvanL1/AetherEdge/releases). Verify and
run the fresh-install package on the target host:

```bash
sha256sum -c AetherEdge-<arch>-<version>.run.sha256
chmod +x AetherEdge-<arch>-<version>.run
sudo ./AetherEdge-<arch>-<version>.run
```

The `.run` package installs the six-service edge Runtime and the `aether` CLI. Releases also contain
standalone CLI archives; those do not install the Runtime. For a source checkout or SDK development,
follow [Getting Started](docs/guides/getting-started.md). Running
`cargo install --path tools/aether --locked` installs only the CLI. See
[Deployment](docs/guides/deployment.md) for Docker and bare-metal package contracts. AetherEdge is
not an npm or Bun package; `npx` and `bunx` do not install it.

## What AetherEdge provides

- **Deterministic edge runtime** — six isolated Rust services continue acquisition, rules, alarms,
  history, and uplink when no AI client is connected.
- **Local-first data plane** — shared memory is authoritative for live point state; SQLite provides
  embedded desired state, history, audit, and durable outbox storage.
- **Machine-readable contracts** — runtime manifests, OpenAPI, capability metadata, Pack manifests,
  experimental CloudLink schemas, MCP tools, and Markdown documentation give agents facts instead
  of prompt folklore.
- **One application boundary** — HTTP, CLI, MCP, and generated clients share governed queries and
  commands instead of writing SHM or storage directly.
- **Domain Packs** — industry knowledge, models, mappings, rules, and processing declarations layer
  over the kernel without becoming core dependencies.

## AI-native product direction

AetherIoT's product direction is to let people describe outcomes in conversation instead of
programming device identifiers, triggers, conditions, and actions through fixed configuration
screens. Agents discover typed capabilities, generate governed proposals, and commission behavior;
AetherEdge executes the accepted behavior locally without the model.

The complete end-user conversational agent is not shipped in the current beta. AetherEdge provides
the foundations it requires today: runtime and Pack discovery, agent-readable documentation,
OpenAPI, MCP tools and resources, governed commands, revisioned configuration, audit evidence, and
deterministic local execution.

The planned platform lifecycle is:

```text
human intent -> agent proposal -> typed contracts -> policy and confirmation
             -> commissioned behavior -> deterministic edge execution
             -> observation, explanation, and governed revision
```

Future intent, proposal, simulation, expiry, and continuous-adaptation capabilities must be added
as explicit application and AetherContracts surfaces. An agent cannot fabricate a device feature,
write SHM or SQLite, bypass confirmation, or become a hidden second configuration authority. See
the [AI-native platform](docs/overview/ai-native-platform.md) and
[platform status](docs/roadmap/status.md) for the delivery boundary.

> **Beta:** AetherEdge is the industry-neutral Kernel, Runtime, and SDK. Existing crates, binaries,
> the CLI, and some compatibility artifacts retain their `aether-*` / `aether` names. This
> repository was formerly named `EvanL1/AetherIot`; software identifiers remain stable during the
> [migration](docs/migration/aetheriot-to-aetheredge.md).

## How agent access is governed

The repository's Agent Skill is optional development guidance, not an AetherEdge software package.
See [Build Applications with AI](docs/guides/build-applications-with-ai.md) if you want to add it to
a compatible assistant.

The optional Skill supplies the development method and pulls current Markdown from the online docs.
MCP supplies live, structured capabilities. Write tools are not registered unless the operator
starts an explicitly write-enabled session, and every write still crosses the server-enforced
permission, confirmation, validation, and audit boundary.

See [Build Applications with AI](docs/guides/build-applications-with-ai.md) for the client contract
and [Agent Quickstart](https://docs.aetheriot.dev/agent-quickstart/) for a complete safe-empty
runtime setup.

## Conversation-first, headless by design

AetherEdge does not ship a generic Web Console. A fixed dashboard cannot express every industry
Pack, and a browser must never become a second configuration authority. Instead, AetherEdge ships
the contracts, Agent Skill, and development guidance needed to generate or maintain fit-for-purpose
applications.

The long-term configuration experience is conversation-first: users describe the result they want,
while an agent generates an inspectable, versioned change. Consequential changes may still produce
an on-demand summary, risk explanation, simulation, or confirmation surface. Those generated views
explain a change; they do not own it.

User interfaces are downstream clients and reference implementations. They consume published
application APIs, remain replaceable, and receive no direct SHM, SQLite, or internal-service
access. The optional AetherEMS Console is one energy-domain implementation of this model.

## Rust SDK

`aether-edge-sdk`, imported as `aether_sdk`, is the only supported Rust
application facade. Workspace implementation crates are source-only and cannot
be published independently. Downstream builds pin the exact commit behind a
signed source release and select local adapters through the SDK's
`local-runtime` feature. The example compositions above are SDK smoke tests,
not the supervised production runtime.

## Edge runtime

| Process | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `aether-io` | Protocol acquisition and sole telemetry/status writer |
| `aether-automation` | Instances, rules, and audited control dispatch |
| `aether-alarm` | Alarm evaluation and lifecycle |
| `aether-history` | Embedded history and optional history adapters |
| `aether-api` | Authenticated remote application API and WebSocket |
| `aether-uplink` | Legacy Cloud/MQTT delivery through a durable local outbox; experimental CloudLink foundation |

```text
Devices -> aether-io -> authoritative SHM
                         |-> automation and alarms
                         |-> API and embedded history
                         `-> durable outbox -> optional cloud

domain <- ports <- application <- runtime/interfaces
             ^
             `---- extensions
```

Only `aether-api` is a remote application boundary. The other process APIs stay on loopback.
Generated clients must use published application capabilities and must not expose or proxy those
internal ports.
