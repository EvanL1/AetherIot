//! On-mmap SHM header — the **physical** layout shared by all readers/writers.
//!
//! This module is pure infra: every field is a generic atomic/integer/byte
//! buffer with no business meaning. The field names retain their historical
//! identifiers (`routing_hash`) for now — that hash is fundamentally a
//! manifest fingerprint computed by the business layer, not something the
//! header itself interprets.

/// SHM layout version.
///
/// - v3 changed the slot default from `(value=0.0, raw=0.0)` to
///   `(value=NaN, raw=NaN)`, so unwritten slots are self-describing instead
///   of relying on the `seq==0` side channel.
/// - v4 added physical padding slots to keep writer-ownership boundaries on
///   fresh cache lines. This changes physical slot indices even when channel
///   point counts are unchanged, so v3 snapshots must be rejected rather than
///   restored into the wrong slots.
