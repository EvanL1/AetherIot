# HTTP API

Aether's HTTP surface spans six services. Browsers and external clients go
through the API gateway (port 6005), which enforces JWT authentication; the
other five services listen on their own ports without authentication and are
intended for intra-host use. This page documents the response envelopes, how
authentication works, and an endpoint overview per service.

## Envelope conventions

**Success** responses are uniform across services
(`SuccessResponse` in `libs/common/src/api_types.rs`):

```json
{ "success": true, "data": { ... }, "metadata": { ... } }
```

`metadata` is omitted when empty.

**Error** responses come in three shapes that coexist for historical reasons.
A client must branch on the shape of the body, not assume one format.

1. **Typed errors** — io handlers return `AppError` and automation's
   `AutomationError` converts into it (`libs/common/src/api_types.rs`,
   `services/automation/src/error.rs`). The body wraps an `ErrorInfo`:

   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "error": {
       "code": 404,
       "message": "Instance not found: pcs_01",
       "details": "...",
       "suggestion": "...",
       "field_errors": { "name": ["must not be empty"] }
     }
   }
   ```

   `details`, `suggestion`, and `field_errors` are optional and omitted when
   absent.

2. **Inline handler errors** — many handlers in history, uplink, alarm,
   and the gateway build the body directly with `json!` (for example
   `services/history/src/routes.rs` and the gateway's
   `services/api/src/routes_auth.rs`):

   ```json
   { "success": false, "message": "No data available" }
   ```

3. **`AetherError` mapping** — the shared errors library defines a third
   shape, a flat object with no `success` field, produced by
   `AetherErrorTrait::into_http_response` (`libs/errors/src/lib.rs`). No
   route currently emits it — the gateway's own handlers use shape 2 — but
   it is the format any endpoint adopting the trait's HTTP mapping would
   return:

   ```json
   {
     "error_code": "NOT_FOUND",
     "message": "resource not found",
     "category": "NotFound",
     "retryable": false,
     "retry_delay_ms": 0,
     "suggestion": "..."
   }
   ```

   `suggestion` appears only when the error has one.

A client talking to the current services will encounter shapes 1 and 2; a
robust client should branch on the presence of the `error` object versus a
top-level `message` (and tolerate shape 3). In every shape the HTTP status
code carries the primary signal; the body adds machine-readable detail.

## Authentication

The API gateway enforces JWT authentication through the `require_jwt`
middleware (`services/api/src/middleware_auth.rs`). REST requests accept a
Bearer token only in the `Authorization` header; query-string tokens are
rejected. The `?token=...` fallback is limited to an actual WebSocket upgrade,
because browser WebSocket clients cannot set custom headers. Missing or invalid
tokens get `401 Unauthorized`.

Coverage (wired in `build_router` in `services/api/src/main.rs`):

- **Protected:** everything under `/api/v1` except `/api/v1/auth`
  (homepage, network, config, broadcast), all of `/api/admin`, and `/ws`.
- **Public transport surface:** `/api/v1/auth/register`, `/login`, and
  `/refresh`, plus `/` and `/health`. Public registration is deny-by-default:
  it returns `403` unless `AETHER_ALLOW_PUBLIC_REGISTRATION=true`, and an
  opted-in registration always creates the least-privileged Viewer role.
  Other auth handlers perform their own token/Admin checks.

Obtain a token with `POST /api/v1/auth/login`; refresh it with
`POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`. Access tokens expire after 30 minutes and
refresh tokens after 7 days by default (`ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`,
`REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS`); the signing secret comes from the required
`JWT_SECRET_KEY` environment variable. It must contain at least 32 bytes;
generate a unique value with `openssl rand -hex 32` and keep it outside source
control.
(`services/api/src/config.rs`).

On a database whose `users` table is completely empty, `aether-api` also
requires `AETHER_BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` before it will start. The value is
the raw password an operator will enter in the login UI, must contain at least
16 characters without surrounding whitespace or control characters, and must
not be a documented/common default. It is converted to the existing
browser-login digest format and bcrypt-hashed; `aether-api` never logs it. Once
any user exists, the bootstrap variable is not read and cannot silently
recreate a deleted administrator.

Every `/api/v1/config/*` endpoint additionally requires the Admin role.
Configuration export and denied remote-upgrade attempts emit structured
authorization events to the service log; a durable audit-ledger adapter is
still required before these logs can be treated as tamper-evident audit proof.

`GET /api/v1/network` remains an authenticated read-only view. Network
mutation is not part of the remote management surface: `PUT /api/v1/network`
and `POST /api/v1/network/apply` require Admin and return `501`. The API's
systemd-networkd mount is intentionally read-only; use an on-device
commissioning workflow with recovery access to change network settings.

The direct service ports — io 6001, automation 6002, history 6004, uplink
6006, alarm 6007 — remain an intra-host surface and must not be exposed beyond
the device. The automation device-action endpoint additionally verifies a
signed access JWT or the dedicated uplink service credential; forwarded
identity headers and loopback reachability are never sufficient. Other local
management endpoints still rely on the intra-host boundary.

## Endpoint overview

This is an overview derived from each service's route registrations, not an
exhaustive parameter reference. All six services have a `swagger-ui` cargo
feature; installer builds made with `./scripts/build-installer.sh
--enable-swagger` enable it for every service, exposing an interactive
OpenAPI UI at `/docs` and the spec at `/openapi.json` on each service port.

Point-type shorthand: T (telemetry), S (signal), C (control), A (adjustment).

### aether-history (port 6004)

Routes from `services/history/src/routes.rs`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/`, `/ping`, `/hisApi/health` | Service info / liveness / health |
| GET | `/hisApi/data/query` | Query a time range of history data |
| GET | `/hisApi/data/latest` | Latest stored values |

| GET, POST | `/api/admin/logs/level` | Read / set runtime log level |
| GET | `/api/admin/logs/files`, `/api/admin/logs/view` | List / view log files |

`/hisApi/health` reports both `backend` (the configured intent) and
`active_backend` (the adapter actually serving requests), together with
`storage_enabled` and `storage_healthy`. The default embedded SQLite backend
is part of the core acceptance contract: if it is enabled but cannot start,
history exits and `aether doctor` reports an error. An explicitly selected
external backend may fail into a visible disabled/degraded state without
turning PostgreSQL or another external service into a core runtime dependency.

### aether-api (port 6005)

Routes from `services/api/src/main.rs`. Everything below except
`/api/v1/auth/*`, `/`, and `/health` requires a JWT.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/`, `/health` | Service banner / health |
| GET | `/ws` | WebSocket upgrade (see below) |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/register`, `/login`, `/refresh`, `/logout` | Account and session lifecycle |
| GET, PUT | `/api/v1/auth/me` | Current user profile |
| PUT | `/api/v1/auth/me/password` | Change own password |
| GET | `/api/v1/auth/roles` | List roles |
| GET | `/api/v1/auth/users` | List users (admin) |
| GET, PUT, DELETE | `/api/v1/auth/users/{id}` | User admin CRUD |
| GET | `/api/v1/auth/stats` | Auth statistics |
| POST | `/api/v1/auth/cleanup-tokens` | Purge expired tokens |
| GET | `/api/v1/auth/validate` | Validate a token |
| POST | `/api/v1/broadcast` | Push a message to WebSocket clients |
| GET | `/api/v1/broadcast/status` | Broadcast hub status |
| GET, POST | `/api/v1/homepage`, `/api/v1/homepage/reset` | Homepage point list / reset |
| GET, PUT | `/api/v1/homepage/{id}` | Homepage point detail / update |
| GET | `/api/v1/network` | Read network configuration (authenticated) |
| PUT | `/api/v1/network` | Disabled (`501`, Admin-only) |
| POST | `/api/v1/network/apply` | Disabled (`501`, Admin-only) |
| GET | `/api/v1/config/check`, `/api/v1/config/export` | Validate / export configuration |
| POST | `/api/v1/config/import` | Disabled (`501`) pending staged validation and atomic rollback |
| POST | `/api/v1/config/restart-services` | Disabled (`501`); use the local deployment-aware CLI |
| POST | `/api/v1/config/upgrade`, `/upgrade/abort` | Disabled (`501`); remote and in-place runtime upgrades are not supported |
| GET | `/api/v1/config/upgrade/status` | Read the compatibility status response only; it does not expose a supported upgrade workflow |
| GET | `/api/v1/data-processing/tasks` | List commissioned task/binding/processor policy summaries (Viewer, Engineer, Admin; mounted only when enabled) |
| GET | `/api/v1/data-processing/processors/health` | Read commissioned processor health (Viewer, Engineer, Admin) |
| POST | `/api/v1/data-processing/process` | Assemble and process a strict task request (Engineer or Admin; non-idempotent, required audit) |
| GET, POST | `/api/admin/logs/level` | Read / set runtime log level |
| GET | `/api/admin/logs/files`, `/api/admin/logs/view` | List / view log files |

The three Data Processing routes are absent when
`AETHER_DATA_PROCESSING_ENABLED` is false. `POST .../process` accepts the strict
application-facing task request—never a complete frame, endpoint, or artifact
path—and returns `aether.derived-data.v1` with media type
`application/vnd.aether.data-processing+json;version=1`. An optional
`x-request-id` supplies correlation; `x-aether-confirmed: true` satisfies an
explicit confirmation requirement. The operation is non-idempotent and fails
closed when its required durable audit cannot be recorded.

### aether-alarm (port 6007)

Routes from `services/alarm/src/routes.rs`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/`, `/health` | Service info / health |

| PATCH | `/alarmApi/alerts/{id}/resolve` | Resolve an alert |
| GET | `/alarmApi/alert-events` | Alert event history |
| GET | `/alarmApi/alert-events/export` | Export events as CSV |
| GET | `/alarmApi/alert-statistics` | Alert statistics |
| GET | `/alarmApi/monitor/status` | Monitor loop status |
| POST | `/alarmApi/monitor/check-rule/{id}` | Manually evaluate one rule |
| POST | `/alarmApi/call-data` | Fetch data on behalf of a rule check |
| GET, POST | `/api/admin/logs/level` | Read / set runtime log level |
| GET | `/api/admin/logs/files`, `/api/admin/logs/view` | List / view log files |

### aether-uplink (port 6006)

Routes from `services/uplink/src/routes.rs`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/`, `/ping`, `/netApi/health` | Service info / liveness / health |
| POST | `/netApi/alarm/broadcast` | Forward an alarm to the cloud |
| GET | `/netApi/alarm/config` | Alarm forwarding configuration |
| GET, POST | `/netApi/mqtt/config` | Read / update the MQTT link configuration |
| GET | `/netApi/mqtt/status` | MQTT connection status |
| POST | `/netApi/mqtt/disconnect`, `/netApi/mqtt/reconnect` | Drop / re-establish the MQTT link |

| GET | `/api/admin/logs/files`, `/api/admin/logs/view` | List / view log files |

## WebSocket

The gateway exposes one WebSocket endpoint, `GET /ws`
(`services/api/src/main.rs`, handlers in
`services/api/src/ws.rs`). The JWT middleware covers it; pass the
token as `?token=...` since browsers cannot set headers on the upgrade
request.

After connecting, a client sends JSON messages:

- `{"type": "subscribe", "data": {"source": "...", "channels": [...],
  "data_types": ["T"], "interval": 1000}}` — subscribe to value updates. The
  hub answers with `subscribe_ack`. Special sources: `rule` (streams a rule's
  latest execution result from local SQLite `rule_history`) and
  `homepage` (streams the configured homepage points).
- `{"type": "unsubscribe", ...}` — clear the subscription.
- `{"type": "ping"}` — answered with `pong`.

Delivery is event-assisted from the SHM PointWatch plane. A point-change hint
wakes affected subscriptions, which read authoritative values from SHM and
send a `data_batch`; a periodic `run_data_push` pass reconciles subscriptions
and provides recovery if an event is dropped. Redis is not in this path.

Control commands over the WebSocket are rejected: writes must go through
automation's `POST /api/instances/{id}/action` or io's channel APIs.
