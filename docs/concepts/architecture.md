# System Architecture

Aether is an AI-native industrial edge gateway built as six independently
supervised Rust services around a shared-memory hot path. Devices are polled by
aether-io, values land in SHM, and each real-time consumer resolves its logical
points from SQLite and reads the segment directly. Optional extensions may
mirror SHM into an external store, but no default service reads that mirror.
The frontend is an optional client and is not an
architecture boundary of the edge kernel.

  SQLite aether.db ───── configuration/discovery for every process
  SQLite history.db ──── default local historian store
  PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB ─ optional history adapter
```

In the reference Docker deployment (`docker-compose.yml`) every container runs
with `network_mode: host`. `/dev/shm` is mounted read/write at `/shm/rtdb` for
the main segments, per-consumer subscription bitmaps, and cross-container UDS
sockets. The five internal process APIs bind to `127.0.0.1`; only the
JWT-protected `aether-api` gateway is remotely reachable. Device actions are
also authenticated again by automation, so loopback headers cannot impersonate
an operator. No core service
mounts a Redis socket or waits for an external database.

## Services

Default ports are defined once in
`libs/aether-model/src/service_ports.rs` and used as fallbacks when
configuration does not override them.

| Service | Port | Role |
|---------|------|------|
| aether-io | 6001 | Communication service — industrial protocol drivers (14 protocols: Modbus, IEC 104, IEC 61850, OPC UA, MQTT, HTTP, DL/T 645, CAN/J1939, GPIO, BLE, Zigbee, Matter, Aether-485, Virtual), channel management, sole writer of telemetry into shared memory |
| aether-automation | 6002 | Model service — product definitions, device instances, rule engine execution |
| aether-history | 6004 | Historical data service — embedded SQLite by default; optional PostgreSQL / TimescaleDB via `postgres-storage` |
| aether-api | 6005 | API gateway — unified REST API, WebSocket push to browsers, JWT authentication |
| aether-uplink | 6006 | Network service — MQTT broker integration for the cloud uplink, TLS certificate management |
| aether-alarm | 6007 | Alarm service — alarm rules, alarm events, notifications |
| aether-apps | 8080 | Optional Vue.js client (`frontend` profile), not a kernel dependency |
| aether-redis | 6379 | Optional infrastructure for the separately built Redis `StateMirror` extension (`redis` profile) |
| TimescaleDB | 5432 | Optional time-series database for historical data, runtime-configured through aether-history |

## Optional Data Processing application

Aether Data Processing adds an industry-neutral application capability without
changing the six-service default. It assembles bounded observation frames from
read-only live state, history queries, request context, and industry-pack
bindings, then invokes a configured local or remote `DataProcessor`.

```text
authenticated HTTP
              │ typed processing query (non-idempotent)
              ▼
  DataProcessingApplication
       ├─ LiveState (read-only)
       ├─ HistoryQuery
       └─ task/context inputs
              │ complete ProcessingFrame
              ▼
         DataProcessor
              │ validated, expiring result
              ▼
       direct DerivedData response
```

The processor is deliberately outside every Aether data authority: it cannot
attach to SHM, read the history database, or resolve a `plant_id` by calling
back into internal service APIs. No processor is required by the default
runtime. A deployment may compose the capability in-process or isolate model
and network dependencies behind a processor sidecar. Version 1 hosts
`DataProcessingApplication` in opt-in `aether-api`; no standalone
`aether-data-processor`, cache, CLI/MCP binding, or scheduler is implemented.
The process name remains reserved for a future orchestration boundary.

The default SQLite read is one invocation-time snapshot, not a bitemporal
historical cut. `as_of` filters event time, while late ingestion, physical
source epochs, and model training/availability cuts require frozen evaluation
inputs or stronger adapters/contracts.

Data Processing never writes the IO-owned T/S plane and never dispatches a
device command. Automation may consume fresh, validated derived data as one
input to a separate planning or control use case, whose authorization, safety,
and audit rules remain unchanged. See [Data Processing](data-processing.md)
and [Data Processing Flow](data-processing-flow.md).

## Communication paths

Latency figures below come from `README.md`; the microsecond numbers are
measured end-to-end on production hardware (Cortex-A55 @ 1.4 GHz, ECU-1170),
with the full benchmark in `libs/aether-rtdb-shm/benches/BASELINE.md`.

| Path | Mechanism | Latency class |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| aether-io → all consumers (live data) | Shared-memory write; each consumer resolves configured slots from SQLite | ~10 ns per point into SHM |
| aether-io → aether-automation/aether-alarm/aether-api (point-change hints) | Independently filtered PointWatch bitmap + UDS per consumer | bounded, sub-millisecond local event path; polling repairs drops |
| aether-automation → aether-io (control commands) | Shared-memory write plus UDS notification (`ShmCommandListener` on the aether-io side) | sub-millisecond; ~215 µs P50 including rule evaluation (measured) |
| aether-io → device (protocol write) | Field bus (Modbus, IEC 104, etc.) | +5–10 ms; dominates the physical control loop |
| aether-alarm → aether-api, aether-uplink | HTTP (targets configured via `AETHER_API_URL` / `AETHER_UPLINK_URL`) | local HTTP |
| aether-uplink → cloud | MQTT | network |
| aether-api → browsers | WebSocket | network |
| all services ↔ SQLite | In-process configuration discovery (`AETHER_DB_PATH`); aether-history uses a separate embedded history file | local |

The UDS notification channel reconnects automatically with exponential backoff
(1–5 s) if aether-io restarts, so an aether-io restart does not require
restarting aether-automation.

Two properties keep the hot path safe:

- **Write ownership.** aether-io is the only writer of telemetry/signal slots in
  shared memory; aether-automation is the only writer of control/action slots. See
  [Shared Memory](shared-memory.md).
- **Events are hints, SHM is truth.** Event consumers always re-read the slot;
  aether-history and aether-uplink retain interval-based sampling semantics.
- **External stores are extension-only.** All six default services start and
  operate without Redis or PostgreSQL. A mirror or history adapter may be
  enabled independently without becoming part of the control path.

## Startup order

aether-io must start before aether-automation. aether-io creates the shared-memory segment and
stamps its header with a `routing_hash` derived from the channel/point layout;
aether-automation can only attach to a segment that already exists and matches its own
view of the layout.

The ordering is enforced in application code, not by making every peripheral
service depend on Redis. Peripheral SHM readers open lazily and can start
before aether-io; a missing writer is a retryable read-time condition. On an
aether-io restart, new point and health generations are fully initialized and
atomically renamed over their canonical paths. Existing consumers keep the
old inode until their periodic identity check reopens the new generation, and
their subscription bitmaps are not truncated:

1. During startup, aether-automation calls
   `common::dependency::wait_for_dependency("aether-io", <aether-io>/health, 30s)`
   (`services/automation/src/bootstrap.rs`). The helper
   (`libs/common/src/dependency.rs`) polls the health URL every 2 seconds
   until it returns HTTP 2xx or the timeout expires. If aether-io is still not
   healthy after 30 seconds, aether-automation logs a warning and continues
   starting — with shared memory possibly unavailable until aether-io comes up.
2. When aether-automation opens the segment, `validate_shm_header`
   (`libs/aether-rtdb-shm/src/unified_shm.rs`) checks the magic number, the
   format version, and that the header's `routing_hash` equals the layout hash
   aether-automation computed locally. On mismatch it refuses to open and reports
   that the writer process (aether-io) must be restarted to resynchronize.

## Configuration flow

```
config/*.yaml ──► aether sync ──► SQLite (aether.db) ──► services load at startup
```

Configuration is authored as YAML (and CSV point tables) under `config/`. The
`aether` CLI parses it and writes it into the shared SQLite database
(`tools/aether/src/core/syncer.rs`); services read only from SQLite — no
service crate parses YAML. Every service container receives the same
`AETHER_DB_PATH` pointing at `aether.db`. To apply a config change, run
`aether sync` and restart or refresh the affected services (`aether services
refresh`).

## Where state lives

- **Live point values** — the shared-memory segment (`AETHER_SHM_PATH`,
  `/dev/shm` on Linux). This is the source of truth for the hot path; see
  [Shared Memory](shared-memory.md).
- **Optional mirrors** — extensions such as `aether-redis-bridge` can observe
  SHM and publish an eventually consistent external view. They are never a
  source of truth and are not startup dependencies of core services.
- **SQLite (`aether.db`)** — all configuration: channels, products,
  instances, rules, service settings. Written only by `aether sync` and the
  services' own config APIs.
- **History database** — embedded `aether-history.db` by default. PostgreSQL /
  TimescaleDB remain opt-in adapters for larger deployments.
