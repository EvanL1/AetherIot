//! Legacy channel-layout projection — **business-side**, not part of `core::`.
//!
//! Slot allocation is implemented only by
//! `aether_shm_bridge::ChannelPointManifest`. `ChannelLayout` projects that
//! typed result into the historical public fields and `u8` lookup API used by
//! io and automation; it does not own layout math.
//!
//! Removal criterion: delete this projection when no production caller
//! imports `ChannelLayout`/`allocate_layouts` and both SHM owners construct
//! their indexes directly from the formal manifest.
