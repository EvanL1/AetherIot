# Aether invariants

These rules are more important than the current directory layout.

1. SHM is authoritative for current point values.
2. A point has exactly one live writer for each ownership class.
3. Configuration discovery never depends on scanning live-state keys.
4. Device commands pass authorization, safety policy, idempotency handling, and
   audit before reaching a driver.
5. Read-only AI capabilities cannot mutate device, configuration, or storage
   state.
6. External-service failure cannot stop local acquisition or local safety
   rules.
7. Offline uplink data is bounded and durably queued before acknowledgement.
8. Redis and PostgreSQL are optional adapters, never startup prerequisites.
9. Domain packs cannot introduce Rust dependencies into the core.
10. AI disconnection cannot affect deterministic runtime behavior.
11. Data processors receive complete, bounded `ProcessingFrame` values from
    Aether; they never discover inputs by reading SHM, history storage, or
    configuration databases directly.
12. `DerivedData` is not authoritative live point state and is never written
    into the IO-owned T/S plane.
13. A data-processing result cannot dispatch a device command. Planning,
    authorization, confirmation, audit, and control remain separate application
    use cases.
14. Missing processors or processor failure cannot stop acquisition, history,
    alarms, deterministic rules, or local safety behavior.
15. `data_processing.process` is non-idempotent: an input digest identifies a
    complete assembled content snapshot but does not promise request replay,
    de-duplication, or a cached result.
16. A live SHM sample may replace only a `Last`-aggregated final history cell;
    it must never stand in for a `Mean`, `Sum`, `Min`, or `Max` interval bucket.
17. A forecast target must never also appear in `future_covariates`; future
    target values are unknown by definition.
18. `as_of` is an event-time frame bound, not proof of a historical knowledge
    cut. An agent must not describe a backtest as leakage-safe unless history
    is frozen/bitemporal with source epochs and the artifact set is frozen or
    carries validated training/availability cuts.
19. Persisted `history_config.storage_*` is saved intent, not proof of the
    active historian writer after a storage update. Data Processing remains
    disabled until reconnect/restart and sentinel verification complete.
20. SQLite read-only flags do not replace OS permissions. Production direct
    history reads give the API an independent read-only historian directory or
    identity, separate from its writable configuration/audit store.
